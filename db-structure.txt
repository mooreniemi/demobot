The current plan is to have one global, per-network DB for network-wide
identity verification etc. and several per-channel DBs for channel-specific
stuff.
I don't think this will still be the case in the final version, but we have to
start somewhere, don't we?
The table specifications listed below are not complete or final, either.

DB-global
TABLE users
- id
- name
- identifier (String supplying all the information needed to verify a user's
  identity. Might contain different stuff for different network setups. In
  the case of Freenode, it's probably going to be the nickname one uses to
  identify with NickServ.)
- login_name, password (Used when no identifier is supplied OR the user doesn't 
  want to use it for some reason, i.e. the user interfaces directly with the
  bot for identity verficiation. Not mandatory, will be empty for most users.
  TODO: Does this have adverse effects on database efficiency?)
- default_profile_id

TABLE profiles
- id
- user_id
- name
- kick_notif
- ban_notif
- topic_notif
- mode_notif

*_notif -> enums (NONE, QUERY, NOTICE, ... something else?)

DB-##channel
TABLE citizens
- id
- user_id (for the global-db table "users")
- profile_id
